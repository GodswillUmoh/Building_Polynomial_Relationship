# Building_Polynomial_Linear_Regression
## Case Study
>Below is a dataset to predict the salary of an individual based on his job position. You as a data scientist is saddled with the role of predicting how much the person to be hired earn in his previous company based on his position

## Dataset
The position is encoded to numbers in the level column, hence we will not be applying OneHotEncoder method
|Position	|Level	|Salary|
|---------|-------|-------|
|Business Analyst|	1|	45000|
|Junior Consultant|	2	|50000|
|Senior Consultant|	3|	60000|
|Manager|	4	|80000|
|Country Manager	|5	|110000|
|Region Manager|	6	|150000|
|Partner|	7	|200000|
|Senior Partner|	8	|300000|
|C-level|	9	|500000|
|CEO|	10	|1000000|
